# System-Analysis-Design-

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is a web based system in which customers of a driving school can schedule tests, classes, and trainings online. 

What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well at analyzing the clients needs for the system and communicating them clearly to the development team. Clear communication and understanding between the development team and the client is highly important. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, it would be my UML diagrams. I believe I could have gone a lot more in depth with my diagrams to convey a clearer understanding of how the system is supposed to function. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by considering software and hardware requirements for the system, as well as considering how a user might navigate and use the website. It's important to consider the user's needs because they are the ones who will be using the system the most. A Streamlined system that is intuitive to use will greatly benefit DriverPass because it makes it easier for users to interact and do business with DriverPass. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
clear communication is most important. A good vision for the design of a system can be achieved through an excellent understanding of the clients requirements and needs. One technique that I would use in the future to analyze and design a system is to really invest a lot of energy into understanding the system's goals and requirements on every level, and asking questions where things seem unclear. Once a good understanding is achieved, designing the system and making diagrams to represent the system is reletively straight forward.
